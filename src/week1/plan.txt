- Exercise that's playing around with references
    - Make a function that takes a read ref to two ints, is_equal
    - Make a function that takes a mut ref to an int, add one
    - Make a function where the easy solution would not work because of mut ref constraints??

- Exercise that's just implementing lots of small vec things
    - Add 3 to end
    - Return length
    - Remove 3th element, return bool false
    - Sum all numbers in vec
    - Sum all the even positions
    - Sum all the even numbers
    - Add 1 to all numbers in vec
    - HIGHLIGHT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PASSING IN REFERENCE AND OWNED!

- Exercise that's just lots of string things?

- Define stack of integers with new,push,pop,size using vec?
    - Make them define the &self part of methods, so we can test if they know &self and &mut self
